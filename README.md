# Technology used
I have used HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) to build my portfolio website. These two are the core languages to build a web page.
HTML is a markup language used to define structure of a web page whereas CSS is a style sheet used to style the web pages by using different styling features.

# Objective
